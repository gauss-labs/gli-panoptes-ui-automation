# Panoptes UI Automation

Practice UI automation framework for Panoptes using Playwright + Pytest.
The framework follows a Page Objective MOdel (POM) structure and supports environment-based configuration and externalized test data.

## Framework Highlights

Key features of this test framework:

- Playwright + Pytest UI automation
- Page Object Model (POM)
- JSON-based test data (externalized and reusable)
- Multi-environment support (--env)
- Reusable and modular pytest fixtures
- Session-scoped login optimization for faster execution
- Modular page components (e.g., filter modal abstraction)
- Data-driven test support
- HTML test reporting + CI-friendly output (JUnit XML)
- Dynamic UI handling (runtime-discovered elements, no hardcoding)

## Test Coverage

Current automated tests:

- Login authentication
- Dashboard UI validation
- Models page functionality
- Search and filtering
- Pagination behavior
- Table interaction and row actions

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt 

playwright install


## Environment Configuration

Environment settings are stored in:

    test_data/env.json

Example:\
```json
{
  "mothership_dev": {
    "base_url": "https://gli-vm-web.dev.mothership.gausslabs.ai",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "gausslabs"
  }
}
```

## Test Data Management

Test input data is managed separately under:
test_data/

Examples include:

- Login credentials
- Model search inputs
- Model creation parameters
- Filter values

## Run tests

Run all tests:

    pytest

Run tests for a specific environment:

    pytest --env=mothership_dev

Run only smoke tests:

    pytest -m smoke

Run only Models tests:

    pytest -m models

## Recent Updates
03/26/2026

- Grouped import statements and sorted them alphabetically within each group


03/18/2026
- Enhance filter modal automation with dynamic selection and improved stability
- Replaced hardcoded filter options with runtime-discovered values
- Added validation for selected filter count and chip area updates
- Added timeout_ms for mitigate flakiness due to slow filter moda rendering


03/16/2026
- Introduced environment-based configuration using env_data.json
- Externalized test data into JSON files
- Refactored Login, Dashboard, and Models tests to remove hardcoded values
- Added reusable logged_in_page fixture
